# Linux Filesystem Mounting Commands

## Manually mount a filesystem
```bash
sudo mount /dev/vg_data/lv_storage /mnt
```
Mounts the device `/dev/vg_data/lv_storage` to the `/mnt` directory. The mount point must exist beforehand.

## View currently mounted filesystems in a clean column format
```bash
mount | column -t
```
Displays all currently mounted filesystems neatly in columns.

## Check disk usage and mounted filesystems in human-readable format
```bash
df -h
```
Shows disk space usage of mounted partitions in a readable format.

## Create a mount point directory (if not already present)
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/mydata
```
Creates a new directory to use as a mount point.

## Mount a device specifying the filesystem type (e.g., ext4)
```bash
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydata
```
Use this if the system doesnâ€™t automatically detect the filesystem type.

## Mount with specific options (e.g., read-only)
```bash
sudo mount -o ro /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydata
```
Mounts the filesystem as read-only.

## Add an entry to /etc/fstab to mount automatically at boot
```bash
echo '/dev/vg_data/lv_storage /mnt xfs defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```
Adds an entry in the fstab file for automatic mounting on system boot.

## Use UUID instead of device path for reliability
```bash
sudo blkid /dev/vg_data/lv_storage
```
Get the UUID of the device for more reliable fstab entries.

## Example /etc/fstab entry using UUID
```bash
echo 'UUID=abcd-1234-ef56-7890 /mnt xfs defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## Test all fstab entries without rebooting
```bash
sudo mount -a
```
Attempts to mount all filesystems specified in `/etc/fstab`.

## Unmount a mounted filesystem
```bash
sudo umount /mnt
```
Unmounts the filesystem from the mount point.

## Force unmount if regular unmount fails
```bash
sudo umount -f /mnt
```

## Check which processes are using the mount point
```bash
sudo lsof /mnt
```
Lists open files and processes using the mount point.

## Remount a filesystem with new options (e.g., read-write)
```bash
sudo mount -o remount,rw /mnt
```
Changes the mount options of an already mounted filesystem.

## List block devices and partitions with mount points
```bash
lsblk
```
Shows devices, partitions, and their mount points.
